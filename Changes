refactor version.

    string, e.g. [ 'Pri-2', 'Mstone-X' ]
* no Home.pm, its related functions are moved to Code.pm, 
    see Net::Google::Code::load and Net::Google::Code::parse
* no Downloads.pm, see Net::Google::Code::load_downloads and Net::Google::Code::Download
* no WikiEntry.pm. see Net::Google::Code::load_wikis, the new Net::Google::Code::Wiki
