    # return a Net::Google::Code::Issue object, of which the id is 30
    $project->issue( id => 30 ); 

    # return a Net::Google::Code::Download object, of which the file name is
    # 'FooBar-0.01.tar.gz'
    $project->download( name => 'FooBar-0.01.tar.gz' );

    # return a Net::Google::Code::Wiki object, of which the page name is 'Test'
    $project->wiki( name => 'Test' );

    # loads all the downloads
    $project->load_downloads;

    my $wikis = $project->wikis;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Google::Code is a simple client library for projects hosted in
Google Code.

Since 0.15, Net::Google::Code offers google's official issues api support.
Besides the new C<Net::Google::Code::Issue::list>,
C<Net::Google::Code::Issue::Comment::list> and
<Net::Googlel::Code::Issue::load_comments> methods, which use the api from
start, you can set C<$Net::Google::Code::Issue::USE_HYBRID> to true to load,
create and update issue with the api too. 

But the official api is not function complete yet( e.g. no attachment
support, can't merge, etc. ), Net::Google::Code will back to the scraping
way to accomplish those stuff.
